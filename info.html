<h2 class="info">Why insects?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Insects are healthy, nutritious alternatives to mainstream staples such as chicken, 
pork, beef and even fish (from ocean catch). </li>
<li> Many insects are rich in protein and good fats and high in calcium, iron and zinc.</li>
<li>Insects already form a traditional part of many regional and national diets.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="info">How does this benefit the environment?</h2>
<ul>
<li> Insects promoted as food emit considerably fewer greenhouse gases (GHGs) than 
most livestock (methane, for instance, is produced by only a few insect groups, 
such as termites and cockroaches).</li>
<li>Insect rearing is not necessarily a land-based activity and does not require 
landclearing to expand production. Feed is the major requirement for land. </li>
<li>The ammonia emissions associated with insect rearing are also far lower than 
those linked to conventional livestock, such as pigs. </li>
<li>Because they are cold-blooded, insects are very efficient at converting feed into 
protein (crickets, for example, need 12 times less feed than cattle, four times less 
feed than sheep, and half as much feed as pigs and broiler chickens to produce 
the same amount of protein). </li>
<li>Insects can be fed on organic waste streams. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="info">Economical and social factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insect harvesting/rearing is a low-tech, low-capital investment option that offers 
entry even to the poorest sections of society.</li>
<li> Minilivestock offer livelihood opportunities for both urban and rural people. </li>
<li>Insect rearing can be low-tech or very sophisticated, depending on the level 
of investment. </li>
<li>They require significantly less water than cattle rearing. </li>
</ul>
